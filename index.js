console.md(`# Welcome!

This is markdown! I can do *lots* of **really** ~~boring~~ interesting stuff!

I can, for example give a [link](https://github.com). Notice that the url is put beside the text
and in brackets.

For now, only a subset of the whole markdown syntax is supported, but I do have the following working:

* All headings
* Standard text
* Bold text
* Inline code
* Block code (although not highlighted)
* Images (only at full size)
* Links (kind of)
* Lists (not nested yet!)

As you may be able to see, there is a few layout issues, but they are to be expected (it is the \`console\` you know!).
There is image support, but they can only appear at full size at the moment. ![](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/800/450).

Also, no raw html is supported, it all must be vanilla markdown 💔.
(Oh, emojis work too! 🔮✨🌟🎶💫☄️⭐️🎤🎧💎)

Try it out!

Just type \`console.md('# Your **Markdown** Here!')\`
